### SHORT SYNOPSIS

Amidst the astonishing poverty of Calcutta streets, one woman creates a miraculous melting pot of potential where rich, poor, destitute, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, children unite, actively rewire their society and create a future of their own choosing.

Meet Maya, who at 5 years old managed to care for her 2-year-old sister for 6 months in the train station alone. Meet Kali, a young girl from the street who now has the power not only to fight for her abused mother, but for the rights of women and girls in general. Meet Saloni, Anamika, Anges and others who are among thousands of other children who are reaching out to care for and educate one another.

Sit Beside Me is the story of a young Irish girl who longed to comfort the untouchables of her own classroom during WWII. At 13, Cyril Mooney resolved to dedicate her life to helping those living in oppression on the margins of society. At 20, she went to India for life, to sit beside those most in need. There she opened the gates of her school to children of all castes, religions and social backgrounds, igniting a surprisingly simple yet radically effective revolution in education.

Filmed over 7 years in Calcutta, Sit Beside Me is a journey into the surprising lives of Sister Cyril's children and how they are remaking their society one child at a time, from the inside out.

You are invited.

### EXPANDED SYNOPSIS

In Calcutta, amidst the greatest urban poverty in the world, where a staggering number of people are born, marry, live and die on the street, a great number are children are abandoned and left on their own to forage for food amid the trash along the tracks of the Sealdah train station. Jumping trains to escape those that would misuse them, girl children are especially at risk. There are so many, but their numbers are dwindling. They have been invited.

We meet:

Saloni, an energetic and luminous young girl abused as a child domestic laborer recounts her harrowing rescue by a student of the Loreto Sealdah school.

Maya, who at the age of 5 walked into Loreto Sealdah school carrying her 2 year old sister in her arms after living alone and foraging for food for 6 months in the train station shares with us her new found life and friends.

Agnes, a young girl whose family moves from living under a staircase to a tiny rooftop, invites into her home, her school and her dreams of the future.

Kali, a street child who after living for years on a highway with her family is now empowered not only to fight for her abused mother but for the education and rights of women and girls in general.

Anamika, who along with other Loreto students, seeks out children abused as domestic slaves, enters the houses where they work, and advocates for their rights.

And Sister Cyril Mooney, the undaunted rivetingly inspiring woman whose vision and determination are carving out space for these children to not only survive and thrive, but to pursue a life of their own making.

Cyril Mooney toppled the ivory tower her first day as principle of Loreto Sealdah inviting in 50% students extremely poor children from the slums. She sent these children out to the villages to sit beside and teach their peers who were living in poverty and without access to equitable education. The new students, half rich and half very poor, then became concerned about the street children living outside the school walls. They can't go to school, they have nothing to eat, no place to sleep. She asked her students what they wanted to do. We will teach them. They will sleep on the roof. We will invite them.  
These rescued street children in turn began a program feeding abandoned widows living alone on the street, developed human rights education curriculum for children, and have rescued hundreds of hidden child domestic laborers by inviting them. Come to school, sit beside me.

We are taking a great trip with Sister Cyril Mooney, the Irish girl who dedicated her life to helping other children, and the thousands of children in Calcutta she has inspired to do the same. Cyril is a visionary and overreaching character whose narration holds the thread of the film, accompanied by five girls who share their extraordinary stories with us by inviting us in to their 'ordinary' daily lives.

Sit Beside Me is a portrait of Sister Cyril Mooney, her philosophy, vision and works. It is therefore the story of the children she has empowered and how they themselves are re-making their society one child at a time, from the inside out. It is working, and it is possible anywhere.

You are invited.

### KEY CONCEPTS/ISSUES

SIT BESIDE ME introduces the concept of Sister Cyril's community-based education, its class/caste-dissolving effects, and the radical child empowerment that is both its means and its goal.

The issues facing the Loreto Sealdah children and their peers in the city that are being addressed by Cyril and Loreto Sealdah are: poverty, and exclusion; child domestic slavery/labor; illiteracy and non-access to education; forced child labor (brickfields, etc); homelessness, risk and abuse; discrimination and marginalization; lack of autonomy, support of one's potential, and respect for human dignity.

The primary issue addressed in the film is the role of schools, education and society. Cyril's pedagogical approach and her success in Calcutta is a clarion call to principals, school systems, ministries of education and societies around the globe. She has proven it can be done in Calcutta, amidst the greatest challenges and most difficult circumstances. It is working, and it can be done anywhere.
