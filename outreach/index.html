<h3>SHORT SYNOPSIS</h3><p>Amidst the astonishing poverty of Calcutta streets, one woman creates a miraculous melting pot of potential where rich, poor, destitute, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, children unite, actively rewire their society and create a future of their own choosing.</p><p>Meet Maya, who at 5 years old managed to care for her 2-year-old sister for 6 months in the train station alone. Meet Kali, a young girl from the street who now has the power not only to fight for her abused mother, but for the rights of women and girls in general. Meet Saloni, Anamika, Anges and others who are among thousands of other children who are reaching out to care for and educate one another.</p><p>Sit Beside Me is the story of a young Irish girl who longed to comfort the untouchables of her own classroom during WWII. At 13, Cyril Mooney resolved to dedicate her life to helping those living in oppression on the margins of society. At 20, she went to India for life, to sit beside those most in need. There she opened the gates of her school to children of all castes, religions and social backgrounds, igniting a surprisingly simple yet radically effective revolution in education.</p><p>Filmed over 7 years in Calcutta, Sit Beside Me is a journey into the surprising lives of Sister Cyril’s children and how they are remaking their society one child at a time, from the inside out.</p><p>You are invited.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/17a2382a-9d0f-4ab7-8239-96c762aadb13.jpg" alt="Maja in 2003, 2007 and 2010. She and her sister Chaia were abandoned by their mother in the train station. Through Sister Cyril&rsquo;s Loreto Day School they now have a home, an education, and a chance to shape their own future."><h3>EXPANDED SYNOPSIS</h3><p>In Calcutta, amidst the greatest urban poverty in the world, where a staggering number of people are born, marry, live and die on the street, a great number are children are abandoned and left on their own to forage for food amid the trash along the tracks of the Sealdah train station. Jumping trains to escape those that would misuse them, girl children are especially at risk. There are so many, but their numbers are dwindling. They have been invited.</p><picture>

<p>Cyril Mooney toppled the ivory tower her first day as principle of Loreto Sealdah inviting in 50% students extremely poor children from the slums. She sent these children out to the villages to sit beside and teach their peers who were living in poverty and without access to equitable education. The new students, half rich and half very poor, then became concerned about the street children living outside the school walls. They can’t go to school, they have nothing to eat, no place to sleep. She asked her students what they wanted to do. We will teach them. They will sleep on the roof. We will invite them.<br>These rescued street children in turn began a program feeding abandoned widows living alone on the street, developed human rights education curriculum for children, and have rescued hundreds of hidden child domestic laborers by inviting them. Come to school, sit beside me.</p><p>We are taking a great trip with Sister Cyril Mooney, the Irish girl who dedicated her life to helping other children, and the thousands of children in Calcutta she has inspired to do the same. Cyril is a visionary and overreaching character whose narration holds the thread of the film, accompanied by five girls who share their extraordinary stories with us by inviting us in to their ‘ordinary’ daily lives.</p><p>Sit Beside Me is a portrait of Sister Cyril Mooney, her philosophy, vision and works. It is therefore the story of the children she has empowered and how they themselves are re-making their society one child at a time, from the inside out. It is working, and it is possible anywhere.</p><p>You are invited.</p><h3>CYRIL MOONEY</h3><p>At 20 years old Cyril Mooney left her native Ireland for India, where for the last 56 years she and her students have developed life saving and society changing programs that have effected tens of thousands in West Bengal.</p><p>Her stunningly effective community-based education does away with competition, celebrates diversity, puts service to others at the heart of the curriculum, turns illiterate street children into scholars in one year, and turns regular schools into effective centers for community development.</p><p>She is an Ashoka fellow, holder of the NOMA Award for Spreading Literacy (UNESCO), and has been awarded the Government of India’s fourth-highest civilian honor. She is an internationally recognized educational innovator whose approach is said to have universal application, and helps to address some of the primary issues in edu- cation around the world today.</p><picture>

<h3>KEY CONCEPTS/ISSUES</h3><p>SIT BESIDE ME introduces the concept of Sister Cyril’s community-based education, its class/caste-dissolving effects, and the radical child empowerment that is both its means and its goal.</p><p>The issues facing the Loreto Sealdah children and their peers in the city that are being addressed by Cyril and Loreto Sealdah are: poverty, and exclusion; child domestic slavery/labor; illiteracy and non-access to education; forced child labor (brickfields, etc); homelessness, risk and abuse; discrimination and marginalization; lack of autonomy, support of one’s potential, and respect for human dignity.</p><p>The primary issue addressed in the film is the role of schools, education and society. Cyril’s pedagogical approach and her success in Calcutta is a clarion call to principals, school systems, ministries of education and societies around the globe. She has proven it can be done in Calcutta, amidst the greatest challenges and most difficult circumstances. It is working, and it can be done anywhere.</p><picture>
